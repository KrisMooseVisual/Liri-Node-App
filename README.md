# Liri-Node-App

## Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface (LIRI)

### In this application the 'Terminal' will allow a user to plug in 4 simple commands to recieve relevant information:
    
    1 - With the command 'node liri.js concert-this <music artists name here>', the user is able to search for information about what musical artist is performing, which venue, the location, and the date of the event.

    2 - With the command 'node liri.js spotify-this-song <song name>', the user is able to recieve information about a music artists name, their songs name, a preview link of the song from Spotify, and the album the song originated on. ("Dazed and Confused" by Led Zepplin will display when there's no song provided as a default.)

    3 - With the command 'node liri.js movie-this <movie name>', the user will recieve information about the movie searched. The title, year of its release, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating, Country of origin, language, plot, and actors in the movie. (If the user does not put in a movie title, the program will default the movie to 'Mr. Nobody' and its information.)

    4 - With the command 'node liri.js do-what-it-says', the LIRI program will place text inside of a random.txt file and use it to call a command from LIRI.

### All of this will be performed from the 'bash/terminal.
